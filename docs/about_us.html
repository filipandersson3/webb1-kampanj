        <h1>About us</h1>
        <p>
            We are a group of students from Umeå studying technology at the NTI school. 
            After having problems with our school lunch being barely edible and at some 
            times not even cooked, we decided to tackle the problem with not just our food, 
            but the school lunches in Sweden in general. All of the pictures on this website 
            of bad food are examples of the food we get served at our school every day. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We know that this isn’t just a problem with our school and that’s why we made this 
            campaign and want your support to fix this problem.</p>
