    <h1>You wouldn't want to eat this</h1>

        If restaurants serving food to students in Sweden don’t have any standards 
        for the quality of the food this is what happens.

    <h1>Make the school meals edible in Sweden</h1>
    <p>
        All students need energy to do school work, so where are they supposed to 
        get that energy if they can’t get it through their food?
    </p>

    <h2>Here are the facts:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>40% of students in Sweden think that the school lunch is either bad or really bad.</li>
        <li>The average cost of one day’s school lunch for one student is 10.47 Swedish Krona.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>We need to make sure that the school lunch is both nutritious and that 
        students are willing to eat it.</h2>
    <p>
        As of 2020 the school laws in Sweden say that the school meals should 
        be free and nutritious. (Skollag SFS 2010:800) However, if the school 
        meals don’t get eaten by the students because they don’t taste good 
        enough then it doesn’t matter if the food is nutritious or not. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Students who don’t eat the school meals then have to buy some other 
        lunch to replace it which costs money and leads to schools no longer 
        being free. Some students can’t afford that and the school might not 
        even be close enough to any restaurants. We don’t think that students 
        should receive gourmet food at school, as that money could be better 
        spent on other parts of the education system, but we think that it 
        should at least be edible. 
    </p>

    <p>
        We could achieve this by increasing the budget for school lunches or 
        setting up a food council that handles any concerns regarding the 
        quality of the food.
