            If restaurants serving food to students in Sweden don’t have any standards 
            for the quality of the food this is what happens.
        </p>

        <h1>Make the school meals edible in Sweden</h1>
        <p>
            All students need energy to do school work, so where are they supposed to 
            get that energy if they can’t get it through their food?
        </p>

        <h2>Here are the facts:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>40% of students in Sweden think that the school lunch is either bad or really bad.</li>
            <li>The average cost of one day’s school lunch for one student is 10.47 Swedish Krona.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="/docs/img/badfood2.png" alt="Example of bad food">
        <h2>We need to make sure that the school lunch is both nutritious and that 
            students are willing to eat it.</h2>
        <p>
            As of 2020 the school laws in Sweden say that the school meals should 
            be free and nutritious. (Skollag SFS 2010:800) However, if the school 
            meals don’t get eaten by the students because they don’t taste good 
            enough then it doesn’t matter if the food is nutritious or not. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Students who don’t eat the school meals then have to buy some other 
            lunch to replace it which costs money and leads to schools no longer 
            being free. Some students can’t afford that and the school might not 
            even be close enough to any restaurants. We don’t think that students 
            should receive gourmet food at school, as that money could be better 
            spent on other parts of the education system, but we think that it 
            should at least be edible. 
        </p>

        <p>
            We could achieve this by increasing the budget for school lunches or 
            setting up a food council that handles any concerns regarding the 
            quality of the food.

        <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
        <h3>People always have differing opinions about food. Why should I care 
            about school lunches?</h3>
        <p>
            Although it is true that people like different kinds of food, if you 
            invited ten guests to your house and four of them didn’t like your 
            cooking, you would probably want to cook something different next time.
        </p>
        <h3>Can I donate to this campaign?</h3>
        <p>
            We are not currently accepting donations, but you can help by spreading 
            the message.
        </p>
        <h3>When is the strike happening?</h3>
        <p>
            We are planning a school strike for 23 March 2021 if everything goes as 
            planned. Students attending the strike will gather outside the school 
            for a day to protest for better food. But this will only work if we 
            get enough students to attend the strike, so you need to spread the word.
        </p>
        <h3>What are your plans after the strike?</h3>
        <p>
            We will evaluate if it worked by sending an anonymous form to all schools 
            in Sweden to compare and see if anything has changed.
